In this lab, you will become familiar with image data and CNN structures through the task of Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset.

You will explore the problem and the dataset through the following notebook:

-   https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/multi-class_classification_with_MNIST.ipynb

The provided notebook includes an implementation of a basic neural network architecture to solve the problem. Your task is to enhance this architecture by incorporating CNN structures, fine-tune the model architecture, retrain the model, and evaluate its performance. Part of your lab grade will be based on the accuracy of your model on the test dataset.

Note: You may create a copy of the provided notebook and work on the "Task 2: Optimize the model" section or implement your solution in a new notebook. Submit your completed notebook file named "MSSV.ipynb" through Moodle.
